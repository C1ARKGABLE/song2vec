# song2vec
Creating a word embedding for lyrics from songs in [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics). Once the word embedding model is created, visualize song similarity and clustering with [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) (or [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) or [CVAE](https://github.com/maxfrenzel/CompressionVAE)) to reduce from ~300 dimensions to 2d. Plot using something pretty, tbh.
